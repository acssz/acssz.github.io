&lt;p>Our team loved sharing a bit of Chinese culture—guests got to try on Hanfu, practice calligraphy, and make bubble tea 🍵✍️💫. It was inspiring to see everyone embracing these experiences, from Hanfu try-ons to brushstrokes of calligraphy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Huge thanks to everyone who stopped by and to AIESEC Zurich for creating such a welcoming, inclusive space that truly celebrates openness, diversity, and shared understanding! We look forward to sharing even more of China’s traditions with our international friends in the future! 🌍&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>China and Switzerland Culture Talk</title><link>https://acssz.github.io/en/event/past/20-01-culture/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://acssz.github.io/en/event/past/20-01-culture/</guid><description>&lt;p>At the beginning of 2020, the Switzerland-China Bridge Association and the Zurich Federation of Students jointly held a Sino-Swiss cultural exchange activity. The event featured Swiss musicians Jason Huster, Anton Zemp and his friends. Anton Zemp and his friends play Alphorn, a traditional Swiss musical instrument, and share the cultural background of this instrument. Jason Huster shared how he met Lang Lang and performed together. He also played piano for everyone at the event.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>You are My Destiny | 520 Making Friends</title><link>https://acssz.github.io/en/event/past/18-05-jiaoyou/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://acssz.github.io/en/event/past/18-05-jiaoyou/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://goo.gl/forms/YyHGtI0lBVAjqtf42" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Click here to sign up&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
